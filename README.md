# Setting up a pre-commit hook to run Ruff linter

## Requirement

- Python - latest version
- Pip installed

## Instructions

To set up a pre-commit hook to run the Ruff linter, ensure you have Python and Pip installed on your system.

1. Install pre-commit by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```pip install pre-commit```


2. After installing pre-commit, activate the pre-commit hook for your repository by running:

    ```pre-commit install```


This will set up the pre-commit hook to run the Ruff linter before each commit, helping maintain code quality standards in your project.
